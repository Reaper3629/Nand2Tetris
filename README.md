# Nand2Tetris Part I: Hardware
## Completed: Jul 7th - Aug 5th, 2024

### Project 1: Boolean Logic
- Created basic logic gates, such as And, Or, and Mux, and their bitwise versions (And16, Or16, Mux16).

---

### Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic
- Created a set of chips to carry out arithmetic addition, including HalfAdder, FullAdder, Add16, and Inc16.
- Constructed an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) chip for the Hack Computer.

---

### Project 3: Memory
- Created a Random Access Memory (RAM) unit for the Hack Computer.
- Utilized gate logic to store bits over time and to locate the memory address for the register on which we wish to operate.

---

### Project 4: Machine Language
- Wrote two programs using the Hack assembly language to multiply and listen to user input to black a screen bitmap.

---

### Project 5: Computer Architecture
- Utilized the ALU, registers, and RAM devices built previously into a CPU and a computer system.

---

### Project 6: Assembler
- Wrote the output file of the assembly process, i.e., a sequence of lines, each being a string of sixteen 0 and 1 characters.
- Programming solution to come...
